    "## Abstract\n",
    ">\"The project is based on the [Home Credit Default Risk (HCDR)  Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview) . The goal of the competition is to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. In order to make sure that people who struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories have a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "During this phase of the project the team will accomplish the following tasks:\n",
    "- Download and load the data from Kaggle.\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
    "- Define several baseline models such as XG Boost, Logistic Regression, and KNN classifier. \n",
    "- Create pipelines to standardize any numerical feature and one hot encode categorial features.\n",
    "- Calculate several metrics to evaluate each model and pipeline.\n",
    "- Record 2 minute video discussing our progress.\n",
